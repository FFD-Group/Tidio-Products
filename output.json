This intelligent combination ensures exceptional speed without drying food, crisp finishes with evenly heated interiors, significantly reduced cooking times compared to conventional ovens and consistent results across multiple menu items. The synergy of these technologies allows operators to increase output, reduce ticket times and maintain premium food quality during peak service.</p>\r\n<h3 data-start=\"1937\" data-end=\"1985\">Dual Cooking Modes \u2013 High Speed &amp; Combi Wave</h3>\r\n<p data-start=\"1987\" data-end=\"2601\">The oven features two distinct operating modes to maximise flexibility. High Speed Mode utilises microwave, convection and impingement simultaneously for ultra-fast cooking. Combi Wave Mode allows the operator to select convection, microwave or a combination of both. This versatility enables you to toast, bake, regenerate and finish with precision, adapt cooking methods to different product types and deliver bespoke cooking programmes tailored to your menu. Whether preparing toasted sandwiches, pastries, pizzas or plated meals, the Lainox Oracle Boosted High Speed Ovens provide complete operational control.</p>\r\n<h3 data-start=\"2603\" data-end=\"2627\">3 Phase Power Supply</h3>\r\n<p data-start=\"2629\" data-end=\"3088\">The 3 phase configuration provides increased power delivery and enhanced speed performance, making the oven ideal for high-demand commercial environments. Faster heat recovery times, increased productivity during peak periods, reliable heavy-duty performance and reduced service bottlenecks all contribute to improved workflow efficiency. For busy operators, this translates directly into higher throughput, improved service speed and stronger profit margins.</p>\r\n<h3 data-start=\"3090\" data-end=\"3141\">Oracle Odorless System \u2013 No Extraction Required</h3>\r\n<p data-start=\"3143\" data-end=\"3716\">A standout feature of the Lainox Oracle Boosted High Speed Ovens is the integrated Oracle Odorless System, engineered to reduce steam and cooking odours at source. This advanced filtration technology minimises vapour emissions and effectively removes odours, negating the need for traditional extraction systems. The result is flexible installation, as the unit fits on a standard commercial kitchen counter and can be positioned virtually anywhere. This reduces capital expenditure, simplifies compliance requirements and opens up new front-of-house cooking opportunities.</p>\r\n<h3 data-start=\"3718\" data-end=\"3758\">7\u201d Configurable Touch Screen Display</h3>\r\n<p data-start=\"3760\" data-end=\"4191\">The intuitive 7-inch touch screen interface allows complete menu customisation to suit your operational requirements. Operators can display only relevant recipes, amend cooking times and settings, upload custom food images for instant recognition and add new menu items with ease. This user-focused control system reduces staff training time, enhances consistency and streamlines kitchen workflow, even during peak trading periods.</p>\r\n<h3 data-start=\"4193\" data-end=\"4239\">WiFi Connectivity and Nabook Plus Platform</h3>\r\n<p data-start=\"4241\" data-end=\"4698\">WiFi connectivity comes as standard, enabling recipes to be uploaded, shared and managed via the Nabook Plus platform. This cloud-based solution provides access to cooking programmes and professional advice from operators around the world. Multi-site businesses can standardise recipes across locations, update menus remotely and continuously optimise performance. The Lainox Oracle Boosted High Speed Ovens are therefore not only powerful but future-ready.</p>\r\n<h3 data-start=\"4700\" data-end=\"4744\">Rapid Cooling System and Oracle Wash Box</h3>\r\n<p data-start=\"4746\" data-end=\"5243\">Cleaning efficiency is essential in commercial catering environments. The rapid cooling system allows the oven to cool quickly after service, reducing downtime and enabling faster turnaround for maintenance. The removable Oracle Wash Box protects the oven chamber and can be easily detached for thorough cleaning. Specialist cleaning chemicals are also available to prevent grease build-up or remove existing residue, ensuring long-term performance, hygiene compliance and reduced servicing costs.</p>\r\n<h2 data-start=\"5245\" data-end=\"5298\">Why Choose Lainox Oracle Boosted High Speed Ovens?</h2>\r\n<p data-start=\"5300\" data-end=\"5802\">In today\u2019s competitive foodservice sector, speed alone is not enough.
